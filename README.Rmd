# testpackage

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of testpackage is nothing but I learned how to make a package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of testpackage from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("juliaradula/test_package")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the functions of testpackage:

```{r example}
library(testpackage)
hello("Julia")
sum_plus_10(3, 5)
```
